I cannot remember
How it was that we first met
Curve of moon and haunted shore
The stars were not those Heaven sent

Did we come together
At masked palatial Balls
In silks and flesh and leather
Or did we come at all?
I dreamt a midnight castle
The eerie song of wolves
And eyes that danced with fire
As they have forever more...
